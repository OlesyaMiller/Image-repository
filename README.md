Welcome to my Image Repository App!

This application lets a user create albums and add images to them. Images can be added upon creation of an album or after the creation. The app lets user delete single images as well as whole albums with images in them (images get erased with the album). 

The app uses 2.6.1 ruby version and Rails 6.0.4.1

To be able to run the app, first install all the dependencies, including the database, by running 'bundle install'.

Next, start the server by running 'rails s' command. Once you have the server running, go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the app!
